# SpectrogramVisualiser

If using this app from scratch, see `requirements.txt` for required packages, or create a python virtual environment and install the requirements. You may need to install pip (`python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`), or `py` as alias before creating a virtual env.

One way you can do so: 
Change directory to this repo and execute: `python venv venv` or `python virtualenv venv` to create a new virtual environment, `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` to enter the virtual environment, then `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Use `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment.

You'll need to install ffmpeg as well if running on your local machine.
