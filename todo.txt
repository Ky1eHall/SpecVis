Add error handling for bad files, return the python error
Add option to use different kinds of audio backends (falltrhough to librosa)
Code gen -> Began, need to parameterise on frontend.
Different parameter settings eg. n_fft and so on. -> Started with win_length

Visual overhaul!
- Need to style form 
- Need to style codegen

Explanations about spectrograms
Links to other stuff, maybe make a second page.
Save spectrograms
Remove currenct spectrogram, or allow a comparison.
Reload with new parameters (colour, n_fft)


BIG NOTE: Flex box primary axis can be aplied to a container div, but for each div inside, the secondary axis can be changed independently of the others in the flexbox
This means that we can push things to top left while other elements are not eg centered, cause can put secondary axis (align-items) as flex-start for one div, rest can just be column or whatever.

Immediate to do:
- get the matplotlib generation of spectrograms going, differing color/proof it works in multiple ways

Can use python -m pip install if pip not on PATH
